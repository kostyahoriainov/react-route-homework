        <h2>Learn based on real market needs</h2>
        <p>In IT, experience is everything. Employers want developers capable of taking on projects and solving problems, things that only real experience can teach you. Thatâ€™s why the 100+ hours in class are heavily practical. Together with a senior practitioner, our groups become teams who work on real projects, just like in a company. Theory is studied independently via our web portal.</p>
        <p>For this to work, our close ties with Beetroot are key. They continuously provide us with their recent projects, so that the skills you learn are top-modern and hot on the market.</p>
        <p>We grew out of Beetroot, a successful IT company from Sweden. But unlike Beetroot, we have no commercial goals. We aim to maximize social impact instead of profit. We want individuals to develop and start new careers, and we want their communities to develop with them. In order to keep our focus on this mission, we have decided to operate as a non-profit. Money is never paid out to owners or investors. Instead, we reinvest that money to improve our courses and teaching conditions.</p>
